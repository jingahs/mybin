Linking Models (instead of appending them):
	-Link them, then go to Object (on the top left, next to Add) > Relations > Make Library Override. THIS USED TO BE PROXY
	-If the model directories change, go to File > External Data > Find Missing Files
	-Overrides - to use the built in model options:
		-You will notice this is needed when trying to modify things and it says can't change library stuff
		-Click the paper clip looking thing. Shift click to make it an override, clicking seems to make a copy in the current .blend file. Sometimes one may work over the other.
			-Can be found in Object Data Properties, next to the name of the Mesh Data (pretty much the top of the menu)
			-Can be found near the Slots in Shading. If the menus don't show in the Shading window, try zooming out/scrolling up.
			-Can be found in Material Properties. Pretty much changes the same stuff as in Shading
Proxies:
	-They are good for using low poly models in workspace (less lag), but rendering high poly ones in the end.
	-Can be done by creating a duplicate model, then OPTIONALLY using a modifier (the blue wrench icon) to reduce polys, such as Decimate > Un-Subdivide
	-Ensure both models are on the same position (x,y,z). Inside of each other.
	-Put both models into a collection, hide the original Object from viewport (the tv screen icon) and hide the proxy from viewport (the camera icon)
	-Add > Collection Instance > Proxy

Troubleshooting:
	-Can't move model: they might be locked in place. Select the model, press N to open up the model menu (to the left of the Scene Collection) and go to Item > unlock the stuff.
	-Using alternate costumes/options for model:
		-Select the model
			-Press N, some models may have a menu for them
			-Go to Shading, then play around with the Slots. There may be some sliders to play around with to toggle opacity of a texture.
	-Model body properties, such as face, body size, etc:
		-Go to Object Data Properties (the green triangle with squares at each corner)
			-Look at Shape Keys. Slide some around to see what they do.

Weight Painting:
	-Select the model, then go to Weight Paint.
		-Select a  Vertex Group (found in Object Data Properties) to display the group's weight paint.

Pose Libraries: (sort of deprecated)
	-Very useful when using models that use the same bones, as they can be reused
	-After posing, go to Object Data Properties (green running guy) > Pose Library.
		-Name the set of poses in the black text bar.
		-Select the desired bones, then add them with the + icon. Remember to name them properly (ex: fist.L)
		-Ensure that the Fake User (shield icon next to black text bar) is checked, otherwise it won't be saved if nothing is using the pose
		-Press Apply Pose Library Pose (magnifying glass under -) to apply pose
	-Not all poses will apply properly if meshes are differently sized

Shapekeys:
	-Purpled out keys can be editted by right clicking and modifying/deleting the drivers

Clothes Physics:
	-Make use of vertex groups to select areas that shouldn't have physics. This way clothes won't fall to the ground.
		-Go to Shape > Pin Group and select that vertex group.
	-Play around with Collisions to get things right.
		-To make other objects collide with clothing, go to their respective Physics Properties tab and slect Collision.
			-If the body is the entire model, you can try to collide with pants instead.

Headswaps:
	-If models explode upon join / transform, they probably have some vertex issues. Try fixing scale, merging by distance, etc.
	-Models change to match their parents when joined, so if there is something like solidify on the parent, the joining model will get it too

Diffeomorphic addon not transferring shapekeys? Try to UNHIDE anything in edit mode.
	-Errors:
		- ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape
		- IndexError: arrays used as indices must be of integer (or boolean) type

Colors not what you want? Compare EVERYTHING in render settings. Contrast is a big factor for Genshins
